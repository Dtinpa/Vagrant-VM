## OVERVIEW ##

* This project is responsible for managing VM's for any project that the user needs, with some adjustment for the user's specific configuration.
* Within the project/ directory, you'll find a bin and configs folder.

## PROJECT/BIN ##

* bin contains scripts used to help setup the VM or setup the environment for your project if you need specific scripts.
* The generatePass.sh script included accepts a commandline argument, and that argument is the password you want for the root user.
* You can just leave root as is, but for my project, I needed it so that the root mysql user had the password I was expecting. That way I can run the import scripts for the DB
* The files it creates go into the configs/ folder
* .dbpass contains the plaintext password, and .secret contains the hashed version.  Rename it however you want, its your project

## PROJECT/CONFIGS ##

* Configs contains config files for various services you might utilize for your project.  I have some for my apache server.
* It also contains the plaintext and hashed password generate from the bin/generatePass.sh script mentioned above.
* You must run this script locally, it won't do anything useful if you're logged into the vagrant machine

## SETTING UP YOUR PROJECT ##

* I mean idk what type-a project you're running, but for me I did a git pull, the contents of which are in the /project folder.
* From there, I make a synced_folder in the VagrantFile, and I sync the project directory to be called /vagrant on the VM
* From there, I create a symlink for the /var/www directory based on my /vagrant directory.
* From there, idk you figure it out, its your project.  There's the modules and manifests folder, but I haven't managed to figure that out yet.
* Modules is supposed to hold the init.pp file for the tool you want to install, but I need to commit sometime rn so I can't explain it.

## MISC ##
* If you run into a segmentation fault caused by ruby at the END of the vagrant up process, you probably will need to install a package for that.  Not sure why, don't care either

vagrant plugin install ffi --plugin-version 1.16.3
